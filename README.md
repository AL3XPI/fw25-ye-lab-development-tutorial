# Fall/Winter 2025 - Ye Lab Development Tutorial

Welcome!

Youâ€™ve already completed your **development environment setup** (VS Code, Python 3.10.11, virtual environment, GitHub account, etc.). This repository is the follow-up GitHub + Python intro task, where you will familiarize yourself with these tools and put your development environment to use.

This tutorial reinforces 4 core skills:
 - Writing Python modules
 - Running Jupyter/Python notebooks locally
 - Using `pytest` for basic testing
 - Working iwth GitHub branches and Pull Requests (PRs)

 
 ### Your responsibilities:
 - Create a folder in the submissions folder, with the same name as your GitHub username: **`submissions/<your-github-username>`**
 - All of your work for this task goes *inside that folder only.*
